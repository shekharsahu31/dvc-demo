pip install dvc

We will track data.txt , so make data.txt and put a line in it

dvc init - one new folder and one new file will be made - .dvc / .dvcignore 

git status - only files - .dvcignore // in .dvc -> .gitignore // config will be tracked not others and we can also put data.txt in .gitignore so that it do not 
             go to GITHUB ,, IN .dvcignore - we add files which need to be ignored by DVC only **

dvc add data.txt - to add file to DVC for tracking # data.txt should be untracked by GIT- to remove -  git rm -r --cached data.txt
                                                                                                       git commit -m "stop tracking data.txt

now you will see data.txt.dvc will be made + in gitignore /data.txt will be added automatically
so now we will have to add git add .gitignore // data.txt.dvc - this file will have hashed codes for data - for tracking the data
